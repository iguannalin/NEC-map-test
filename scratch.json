As an incubator, we provide pre-launch support, business & leadership development, governance and conflict resolution trainings, and legal, bookkeeping, and administrative support. Our pre-launch support includes a monthly stipend to offset the cost of participating in training.\n\nWe believe in the solidarity economy.  Solidarity economics is, as Jessica Gordon Nembard writes in the introduction to The Black Social Economy in the Americas, a people-centered “alternative grassroots economic framework grounded in solidarity and cooperation for the common good, first articulated in Brazil and in the nonaligned world [in the latter half of the 20th century], but practiced for centuries.” Solidarity economics is also deeply rooted in mutual aid. We understand mutual aid as practices of neighbors collaborating to help meet each other’s survival needs.  Because the current capitalist political economy does not meet the needs of our communities, we also engage in movement building and grassroots organizing to win sweeping changes for workers.",

Our long term vision is to develop a cooperative network based in Jackson, Mississippi that will consist of four interconnected and interdependent institutions: a federation of local worker cooperatives, a cooperative incubator, a cooperative education and training center (the Kuwasi Balagoon Center for Economic Democracy and Development), and a cooperative bank or financial institution.\n\nCooperation Jackson’s basic theory of change is centered on the position that organizing and empowering the structurally under and unemployed sectors of the working class, particularly from Black and Latino communities, to build worker organized and owned cooperatives will be a catalyst for the democratization of our economy and society overall.\n\nCooperation Jackson believes that we can replace the current socio-economic system of exploitation, exclusion and the destruction of the environment with a proven democratic alternative. An alternative built on equity, cooperation, worker democracy, and environmental sustainability to provide meaningful living wage jobs, reduce racial inequities, and build community wealth. It is our position and experience, that when marginalized and excluded workers and communities are organized in democratic organizations and social movements they become a force capable of making transformative social advances.",

      "Organizational mission": "Cooperation Jackson is an emerging vehicle for sustainable community development, economic democracy, and community ownership. Our long term vision is to develop a cooperative network based in Jackson, Mississippi that will consist of four interconnected and interdependent institutions: a federation of local worker cooperatives, a cooperative incubator, a cooperative education and training center (the Kuwasi Balagoon Center for Economic Democracy and Development), and a cooperative bank or financial institution.\n\nCooperation Jackson’s basic theory of change is centered on the position that organizing and empowering the structurally under and unemployed sectors of the working class, particularly from Black and Latino communities, to build worker organized and owned cooperatives will be a catalyst for the democratization of our economy and society overall.\n\nCooperation Jackson believes that we can replace the current socio-economic system of exploitation, exclusion and the destruction of the environment with a proven democratic alternative. An alternative built on equity, cooperation, worker democracy, and environmental sustainability to provide meaningful living wage jobs, reduce racial inequities, and build community wealth. It is our position and experience, that when marginalized and excluded workers and communities are organized in democratic organizations and social movements they become a force capable of making transformative social advances.",

We seek a stronger, fuller democracy – in our politics and culture as well as in our economy - based on workers’ equal collaboration and shared leadership inside enterprises and throughout society.",

The people that work for the co-op are also the owners. Each worker-owner invests in and democratically runs the business.   It was the dream of the founding members of Pecan Milk Cooperative to set out on a journey of discovery to develop a business collectively run primarily by young Black LGBTQ folks in Atlanta. Since then, our beliefs and mission for this co-op have not faltered.  Pecan Milk Cooperative creates dignified work for  1. lesbian, gay, bisexual, queer and transgender communities, 2. people of African descent and 3. other people of color, 4. women, 5. youth, 6. immigrants and 7. folks with a disability throughout a broadly defined South. A Cooperative is a people-centered organization that is jointly owned, run and democratically controlled by and for its own members in an effort to achieve their common economic, social, and cultural needs and aspirations. Shown here is the logo of the International Cooperative Alliance. Established in 1895 to promote the cooperative model, this organization is the voice of upwards of  3 million cooperatives worldwide, acting together to build a better world. As an enterprise based on values and principles, we put fairness and equality first, allowing our worker-owners to create a sustainable system that can generate long-term jobs and prosperity. It is our belief that by forming our organization this way, we can allow our worker-owners to take control of their economic futures and, because they are not owned by shareholders, the economic and social benefits of their activity is more likely to stay in the communities wherein we are established.",

      "Organizational mission": "Pecan Milk Cooperative is a worker-owned cooperative providing dignified work for LGBTQIA, BIPOC, women, people with disabilities, and other marginalized communities in a broadly defined South.\n\n\n\n\n\nPecan Milk Co-op is a worker-owned business based in the South. The people that work for the co-op are also the owners. Each worker-owner invests in and democratically runs the business.   It was the dream of the founding members of Pecan Milk Cooperative to set out on a journey of discovery to develop a business collectively run primarily by young Black LGBTQ folks in Atlanta. Since then, our beliefs and mission for this co-op have not faltered.  Pecan Milk Cooperative creates dignified work for  1. lesbian, gay, bisexual, queer and transgender communities, 2. people of African descent and 3. other people of color, 4. women, 5. youth, 6. immigrants and 7. folks with a disability throughout a broadly defined South. A Cooperative is a people-centered organization that is jointly owned, run and democratically controlled by and for its own members in an effort to achieve their common economic, social, and cultural needs and aspirations. Shown here is the logo of the International Cooperative Alliance. Established in 1895 to promote the cooperative model, this organization is the voice of upwards of  3 million cooperatives worldwide, acting together to build a better world. As an enterprise based on values and principles, we put fairness and equality first, allowing our worker-owners to create a sustainable system that can generate long-term jobs and prosperity. It is our belief that by forming our organization this way, we can allow our worker-owners to take control of their economic futures and, because they are not owned by shareholders, the economic and social benefits of their activity is more likely to stay in the communities wherein we are established.",

Transforming ownership and redesigning institutions lies at the heart of this work. Critical to catalyzing such a systemic transformation is overcoming the isolation and despair that prevents us from recognizing ourselves as agents of fundamental historical change. Our goal is an American community in which wealth is democratized, ecological resilience is regenerated, and the marginalized become the core of concern, as the nation reknits the economic fabric of interdependence without which our democracy becomes an empty abstraction.The Democracy Collaborative turns ideas of systemic design and community wealth building into visions and models that demonstrate new principles of a democratic economy operating within planetary boundaries, while also helping to lay the pathways for systemic transformation. We seek points of maximum leverage that unlock action and inspire on-the-ground change in economic culture, practice, and policy. At the same time, we work to stimulate new thinking about how longer term democratic, systemwide change can be achieved. In these ways, we help communities and our nation lay the foundation for a democratic economy built upon liberty, community, and prosperity for all.",

      "Organizational mission": "The mission of The Democracy Collaborative is to help catalyze a moral and political transformation of the US political economy into a next system that is inclusive, just, and ecologically sustainable—in contrast to today’s amoral economy of financial extraction. Transforming ownership and redesigning institutions lies at the heart of this work. Critical to catalyzing such a systemic transformation is overcoming the isolation and despair that prevents us from recognizing ourselves as agents of fundamental historical change. Our goal is an American community in which wealth is democratized, ecological resilience is regenerated, and the marginalized become the core of concern, as the nation reknits the economic fabric of interdependence without which our democracy becomes an empty abstraction.The Democracy Collaborative turns ideas of systemic design and community wealth building into visions and models that demonstrate new principles of a democratic economy operating within planetary boundaries, while also helping to lay the pathways for systemic transformation. We seek points of maximum leverage that unlock action and inspire on-the-ground change in economic culture, practice, and policy. At the same time, we work to stimulate new thinking about how longer term democratic, systemwide change can be achieved. In these ways, we help communities and our nation lay the foundation for a democratic economy built upon liberty, community, and prosperity for all.",

We send these roots of opportunity into the community, sprouting up co-operatively run and green projects and initiatives that build toward our vision of neighborhoods that are safe for living, working and playing. Our organization was founded to address the environmental justice concern of lead in the soil. In 2005, Worcester Roots made the decision to prioritize youth empowerment through its projects. In 2008, we expanded our focus to address economic, social and environmental justice. Within our focus on economic justice, we have a particular interest in supporting worker co-operatives (businesses or projects that are run and owned by workers) and promoting the development of green jobs in our city.",
